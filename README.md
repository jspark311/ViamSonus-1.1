Viam Sonus *("Sound Route")* is an IoT audio multiplexer implemented on top of a Teensy3.1 running ManuvrOS.

####What is in this repository:
**./3DModels**: Blender models of the physical pieces that comprise a finished unit.

**./doc**:  Documentation related to this project.
    
**./KiCAD**:  KiCAD project data for building a unit.

**./src**:  Original (unless otherwise specified) source code.

####Building the device firmware in the Arduino IDE

This project has ManuvrOS as a dependency. You will first need to add it to your arduino libraries:

    git clone https://github.com/Manuvr/ManuvrOS
    cd ManuvrOS*
    mv ManuvrOS StringBuilder DataStructures <your teensy3.1 library path>

Because this project relies on libraries being includable by other libraries, you will also have to 
make repairs to your Arduino environment (if you haven't already) [as described here](http://www.joshianlindsay.com/index.php?id=147). But trust me: this will make your life *much* easier.

Then, you will need to (move, copy, or link) the folders in the Drivers directory to the ManuvrOS/Drivers directory...

    cd src/Drivers
    ln -S * <your teensy3.1 library path>/ManuvrOS/Drivers/

Open up the sketch and it ought to compile for you.

####Building the device firmware for a RasPi

This project relies on certain capabilities of the Teensy3.1, but a feature-restricted RasPi build is possible in-principle. If there enough interest, I will post instructions for it.
